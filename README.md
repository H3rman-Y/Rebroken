# Game Thoughts
    Each time loop consists of an intro, bringing up breaking up, breaking up, and resolution. The gameplay consists of choosing one of three cards dealt to you from a deck of mostly bad cards. Some examples  of what these cards are are: insult, beg, and cry, while some of the good cards are things like listen and kind words. In each section you will choose one card and depending on how well you choose that  will  effect a “hurt feeling/understanding meter”. If in a loop you hit a certain threshold on that meter you get to remove certain cards from your deck. Each successful round corresponds to one of the 5  stages of grief, and the first time you pass round you will remove the cards corresponding to that stage(ie insult and blame for anger) so that over time you get a better and better deck and can eventually have a run where you just do the good stuff.
