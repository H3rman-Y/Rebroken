## Project Description

Rebroken is a game that explores themes related to emotional healing and personal growth. It is designed around the concept of going through five stages of grief, and the gameplay involves making choices from a deck of cards. The goal is to progress through the stages of grief and build a deck of positive cards while removing negative ones. The game offers players an opportunity to understand and manage their emotions.

## Game Thoughts

Each time loop in the game consists of an intro, progression through breaking up, and finally, resolution. The gameplay is centered around selecting one card from a deck of cards, with most being negative cards like insults, begging, and crying, and some being positive cards like listening and kind words. Your choices affect a "hurt feeling/understanding meter." Reaching a certain threshold on this meter during a loop allows you to remove specific cards from your deck.

The game's progression aligns with the five stages of grief, and as you successfully navigate each stage, you can remove cards corresponding to that stage. For example, in the anger stage, you can remove cards like insults and blame, allowing you to build a better deck over time. The ultimate goal is to create a deck filled with positive cards and have runs where you make positive choices throughout.

## Stages of Play

- **Intro Stage**: The intro stage consists of the setup conveyed to the player. This will set the stage for everything and serve to introduce the purpose of the various game actions as well as UI.

- **Initial Loop Stage**: The girlfriend sets the scene, and then the player is prompted to interact. They will use knowledge gained in the intro stage to interact with various cards, choosing which one they want and seeing the results play out in the form of dialogue and changes in their meters. This repeats for five cycles called turns or until a meter reaches 0, at which point you go to the discard stage.

- **Discard Stage**: Appended onto the end of the initial loop stage and all subsequent loops. Involves the selection of cards for removal from the total pool from a roster of cards seen in the current loop. Upon completion of this stage, the meters reset, and the player is transported to the next loop.

- **Subsequent Loops**: Functions much the same as other loops but with the caveat that the game can be completed on these loops. In the event that a player reaches 10 on either the emotion or feeling meter, the game ends, and an ending scenario plays.
