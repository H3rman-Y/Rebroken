  Dialogs:
  - You smell like an unwashed swine!
  - How rude! Do you really expect me to feel appreciated when you talk to me so?
  - You're a bad person!
  - Setting boundaries and taking care of myself does not make me a bad person. It
    makes me human.
  - You have no idea how to treat a man!
  - You clearly have no idea how to treat a woman if you would rather hurl insults
    at me than talk through this civilly.
  description2: '"Show her how you really feel. She''s not the only one hurting."'
