  Dialogs:
  - I like the color of your shoes!
  - Flattery will get you nowhere. Your vapid compliments fall flat in the face of
    your deep and impactful failings.
  - Lovely weather we're having.
  - Shitty conversation we're having. Stay on topic!
  - You know what, we should get a pizza!
  - For our breakup conversation? Why? I doubt pizza will fix the rift in this relationship
    and I hardly feel like eating.
