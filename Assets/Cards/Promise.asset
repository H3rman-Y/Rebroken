  Dialogs:
  - I promise that from now on I'll be a much better partner! I'll take care of everything
    and you won't have to worry about anything!
  - You know that isn't realistic. Staying will mean more of the same.
  - I promise that from now on I'll stop wasting away here at home. I'm going to
    get out there and make a real difference in our lives.
  - 'This isn''t the first time you''ve said that, and you always give up in like
    a week. '
  - C'mon please stay! I'll buy you lavish jewelry and all the steak you can eat!
  - Trinkets and baubles won't fill the void in my heart, and quite frnakly neither
    do you anymore.
