  - I promise that from now on I'll be a much better partner! I'll take care of everything
    and you won't have to worry about anything!
  - 'You know that isn''t realistic. I don''t want you to bend over backwards trying
    to make this work. '
  - I promise that from now on I'll stop being so cold. I'm going to show you how
    much you mean to me.
  - This isn't the first time you've said that... I don't believe you.
  - Please, Willow. I'll do anything. Just tell me what I need to do. I'll be anything
    you need of me.
  - I won't do that, Rain. You deserve a parenter who wants the love you're already
    giving. I'm just not that person.
