  - P-P-Please don't leave me!
  - .......You're begging me to stay? Really?
  - But you gotta stay! You gotta!
  - I am an independent person and I don't have to do anything I don't want to.
  - Come on! Please, stay, pleeeease!
  - I'm sorry, but I just don't see a way forward and you aren't going to convince
    me with your pleases, no matter how ardent they may be.
