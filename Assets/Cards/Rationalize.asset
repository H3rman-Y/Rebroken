  - 'I''m sorry I haven''t always been there for you, but you know I have been really
    depressed recently. '
  - I get that, but at some point I need to consider my own needs. I care about you,
    but I sometimes just don't feel that back.
  - I'm really sorry I forgot your birthday last week, I've just been so busy with
    stuff.
  - Are you serious?!?! Save it! That really hurt my feelings and you are trying
    to justify it!
  - I'm sorry I don't attend to your feelings, but you have to understand no one
    ever taught me how to.
  - And this burden rests on me? Why am I so lucky?
