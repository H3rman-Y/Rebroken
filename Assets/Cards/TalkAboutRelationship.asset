  - Ever since the day I met you I knew I wanted to spend the rest of forever with
    you. I know I haven't been the best, but I really enjoy spending time with you.
  - 'I know, I know. But Rain, we haven''t really even been spending time together.
    We are just existing in the same space, and I need to go out and have my own
    adventures again. '
  - I know things aren't working out. But I still love you so much that I can't stand
    the thought of not being together. I hate myself for being such a bad partner.
  - I love you too. But I think we have been together for longer than we should have.
    This doens't have to be a bad thing.
  - I just feel like you are the one thing in my life that was going right. I really
    love you and I don't want to lose you.
  - In truth some part of me still loves you too, but that feels more like a vestigial
    remnant of the love we once had. We're new people now and I think trying to pretend
    we're not is making us worse.

    the words spill out of your mouth, you know it''s true."'
