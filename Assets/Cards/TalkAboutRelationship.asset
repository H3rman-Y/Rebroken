  - Ever since the day I met you I knew I wanted to spend the rest of forever with
    you. I know I haven't been the best, but I really enjoy spending time with you.
  - 'I know, I know. But Rain, we haven''t really even been spending time together.
    We are just existing in the same space, and I need to go out and have my own
    adventures again. '
  - I don't know what I will do with out you, even my mom left me. I understand that
    I haven't been the best to you, but I really am best for you and I will always
    be here for you.
  - You are right, you haven't been the best. I've enjoyed having someone to fill
    the time with, but all things must come to an end, and I think we have been together
    for longer than we should have.
  - I just feel like you are the one thing in my life that was going right. I really
    love you and I don't want to lose you.
  - In truth some part of me still loves you too, but that feels more like a vestigial
    remnant of the love we once had than a burning fire that can carry me through
    life with you.
