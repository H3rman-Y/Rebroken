  Dialogs:
  - I have been really depressed and awful to you. It makes it hard to be there for
    you. That isn't fair and I am sorry.
  - Thank you for saying that, Rain. It made things really lonely for a while.
  - Maybe we aren't compatible. I feel like it can be so hard for us to get through
    to eachother. I don't think it's supposed to be this hard.
  - 'It wasn''t... at first. I wish I knew how this happened. '
  - Yeah, I'll admit things weren't always great. You're right about me and there's
    a lot of things you do that hurt me too.
  - I know. I'm not perfect but neither of us deserve to be in pain.
