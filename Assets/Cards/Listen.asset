  Dialogs:
  - Sorry, go ahead and tell me why you want to break up.
  - 'I just don''t feel that spark anymore. We used to find so much joy in every
    moment together, but now it is just day in, day out more of the same. '
  - What prompted you to want to end it?
  - It's just a lot of little things. It feels like our life has just been stagnant
    and we are doing the same thing over and over, like we are caught in a time loop.
  - '*rests fist on chin* I''m listening. What do you have to say?'
  - Well (goes on a long diatribe about Rain which Rain perceives only as gibberish)
