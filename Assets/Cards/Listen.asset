  Dialogs:
  - I'm sorry. You deserve to be listened to. Go ahead and tell me what you're feeling.
  - I just don't feel that spark anymore. We used to find so much joy in every moment
    together, but now it is just... It feels like we're trying to put up with eachother.
    It's not natural anymore.
  - When did you know you wanted to do this?
  - It's just a lot of little things. It feels like our life has just been stagnant
    and we are doing the same thing over and over, like we are caught in a time loop.
  - I'm sorry, I haven't let you say what you need to say. Please *gestures for Willow
    to speak*
  - Well... It feels like being together is only making things worse. I never used
    to be so lethargic all the time, and you never used to lash out at me like this.
    Don't you ever feel like we're just pulling eachother into a downwards spiral?
