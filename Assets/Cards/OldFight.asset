  Dialogs:
  - This is just like when you gave me flack over my mother's comments!
  - You're mother called me a harlot!
  - Why do you always default to trying to hold my emotions hostage whenever you
    feel somewhat dissatisfied? You always do this when we fight!
  - Hold your emotions hostage? I'm just asserting my right to decide my own destiny.
    If you can't see that you're even less perceptive than I thought you were!
  - This is so you! Always try and torpedo the relationship whenever we quarrel!
  - Me torpedo the relationship? You torpedoed the relationship with your brutish
    ways and your pigheaded handling of my emotions! Case in point!
