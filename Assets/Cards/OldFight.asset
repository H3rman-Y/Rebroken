  Dialogs:
  - This is just like when you yelled at me for working late all the time. I can't
    help it!
  - Working late? You missed my birthday dinner!
  - Why do you always default to trying to hold your emotions hostage whenever you
    feel somewhat dissatisfied? You always do this when we fight!
  - Hold my emotions hostage? I'm just asserting my right to decide what this relationship
    is. If you can't see that you're even less perceptive than I thought you were!
  - This is so you! Always try and torpedo the relationship whenever we have a disagreement!
  - Me torpedo the relationship? You torpedoed the relationship with your inability
    to listen to me? How can we have a relationship when I can't even speak openly
    with you?
