  Dialogs:
  - I really love you, Willow, and I want to be better for you.
  - 'I love you too, but you should try to be better for your own sake. '
  - Thank you for being so honest with me. You're such a good person, even when I'm
    acting awfully.
  - I don't like being yelled at, but I know you're just scared. You've shown me
    a lot of kindness in our lives. I appreciate you saying that to me.
  - Even if I' mstarting to agree with you, I'm so scared of what this means. What
    if I don't know how to be on my own again? What if I spend the rest of my life
    regretting this?
  - I'm worried too. I don't even know where I'm gonna go when I move out. But aren't
    you even a little bit excited to think about who we could be?
