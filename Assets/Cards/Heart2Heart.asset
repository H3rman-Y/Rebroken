  - I really love you Willow and I want to be better for you.
  - I love you too, but we both know that things won't change if I stay.

  - I can't rely on you Rain. I really love you, but I can't always be there for
    you. We both deserve to be in a relationship where we are both happy.

    don't want to lose you.

    anymore.
